<sub> I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Peking University and very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qingni Shen](https://ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/1634-%E6%B2%88%E6%99%B4%E9%9C%93.html). 
I have been a visiting Ph.D. student at the Nanyang Technological University advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) since December 2023. I also work closely with Prof. [Jiaheng Zhang](https://zjhzjh123.github.io/).
 
<sub> I was a research intern at [TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and Dr. [Yinpeng Dong](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/) from September 2022 to October 2023.

<sub> My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy AI, especially backdoor attacks/defenses and adversarial attacks. **Recently, I focus more on the vulnerability and privacy issues of Text-to-Image Models and large Language Models**. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in our work, and I am always willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators.
