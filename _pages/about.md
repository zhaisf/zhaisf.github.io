I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Peking University and very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qingni Shen](https://ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/1634-%E6%B2%88%E6%99%B4%E9%9C%93.html). 
 I work closely with Prof. [Jiaheng Zhang](https://zjhzjh123.github.io/).  And I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and Dr. [Yinpeng Dong](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/) from Tsinghua University.
 
   I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Nanyang Technological University advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) from December 2023 to August 2024.

  My research mainly focuses on Trustworthy AI. **Recently, I focus more on the security, privacy and copyright issues associated with generative models, particularly diffusion models and large language models (LLMs)**. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in our work, and I am always willing to work together on interesting projects with external collaborators.

  <font color='red'>I am actively seeking for a researcher position starting in the winter of 2025. Please feel free to contact me at shengfang.zhai AT gmail.com.</font>
